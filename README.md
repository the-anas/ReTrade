# ReTrade

This repository contains all the necessary files to run ReTrade. ReTrade is a public free API that I have built as my final project for my Web Services IT325 Course. This API is built using the flask web framework and manages its data through a flask-SQLAlchemy database. This API also includes numerous other packages and functionalities that you will find listed under the requirements.txt file. 
The goal behind this project is to build a virtual trading platform, otherwise known as a paper trading platform. This API allows its users to virtually buy and sell stocks that are listed on the NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE (NYSE). It also provides other functionalities, such us viewing how a stock has been performing recently, and opens the door for possible future improvements.
